        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-100">What is Rektroactive?</h3>
        <p>
          It's like a time machine for your crypto regrets, except instead of fixing them, 
          we reward you for being hilariously bad at trading memecoins.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-100">How do I participate?</h3>
        <p>
          Step 1: Connect your wallet. Step 2: Cry about your past trades. Step 3: Get rewarded for them anyway. 
          It’s like therapy, but with memes.
        </p>

      <li>
        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-100">What prizes can I win?</h3>
        <p>
          Legendary memecoins like PEPE, NFTs immortalizing your degenerate choices, 
          and eternal bragging rights for being "rekt but rich."
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-100">Why does this exist?</h3>
        <p>
          Because someone had to turn our collective crypto pain into a game. 
          And who doesn’t love laughing at their own financial mistakes?
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-100">Can I enter if I made good trades?</h3>
        <p>
          Sure, but we reserve the right to laugh at you for not being rekt enough. 
          This is a degenerate’s playground, not Wall Street.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-100">Will participating make me rich?</h3>
        <p>
          Maybe not financially, but spiritually, you'll be rolling in laughter and memes. 
          Isn’t that what crypto is all about?
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-100">What if I never bought memecoins?</h3>
        <p>
          Then you clearly missed out on the true crypto experience. But hey, 
          there’s still time to ape into something questionable!
